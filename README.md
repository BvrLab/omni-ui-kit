This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

This component library comes with a Next.js project pre-configured with TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier, and Tailwind CSS, which is used to test the components.

To run the next.js app, first run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Storybook

We use [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) to test the components without serving any react app.

To run the storybook, first run:

```bash

npm run storybook

```
Open [http://localhost:6006](http://localhost:6006) with your browser to see the result.

## TODO 

- [ ] Add more components (roadmap being planned)
- [ ] Configure the repo to publish the package to npm
- [ ] Create a repo template for a Next.js React App using this component library
